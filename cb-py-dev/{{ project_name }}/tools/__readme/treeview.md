Initial structure of the tools folder
-------------------------------------

Here is the initial content of the `tools` folder proposed by cb-py-dev copier templates avaiable in [this page][1], which serves as the basis for developing "in-house" tools.

~~~
+ tools
  + 01-contrib
    * 90-README-folders-struct.py
  + cbutils
    + core
  * launch.bash
  * 90-update-READMEs.py
  * README.md
~~~


The following sections explain how this set of files and folders works.
