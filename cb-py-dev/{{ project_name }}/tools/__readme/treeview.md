Initial structure of the tools folder
-------------------------------------

Here is the initial content of the `tools` folder proposed by cb-py-dev copier templates avaiable in [this page][1], which serves as the basis for developing "in-house" tools.

~~~
+ tools
  * launch.bash
  * README.md
  + 01-contrib
    * 90-README-folders-struct.py
  + utilities
    * README.md
    * __init__.py
    + core/
      * __init__.py
      * common.py
      * cnp_code.py
      * need_tests.py
~~~


The following sections explain how this set of files and folders works.
